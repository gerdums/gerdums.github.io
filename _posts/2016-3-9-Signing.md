“I chose to attend The Master’s College because of its strong Biblical foundation, and how both on and off the course its athletes live out their faith,” said Matson. “I was amazed at the God-honoring environment at TMC and I am looking forward to not just growing as a runner, but as a follower of Christ.”

Matson enters his time as a Mustang with an impressive academic and athletic resume crafted at Plymouth Christian Academy, a member of the Michigan Independent Athletic Conference (MIAC).

Based on his performance in the classroom, Matson was recognized on the Michigan High School Athletic Association Academic honor list his junior and senior years. In addition, Matson also earned a spot in the National Honor Society.

Athletically, Matson was named All-MIAC second-team his sophomore and junior years, All-MIAC first-team his senior year, served as a captain on his cross country team his sophomore, junior, and senior years, and was also named captain for his school’s track team his junior and senior years.

Already looking ahead to his time as a Mustang, Matson has his eyes fixed on achieving a number of admirable goals.

“I hope to grow as a runner, bring my best to the team, and continue to run for the glory of God.”

When not competing, Matson plans to major in Biblical Studies for a career in ministry.

Commenting on Matson’s signing, TMC cross country and track head coach Zach Schroeder said, “We are thrilled to add Gareth to our roster.  He has a heart that is sensitive to the Lord and is eager to learn what it means to follow Christ through athletics. Gareth’s evident love for people will certainly add to the spirit of our team.”

Looking to another fruitful season, both teams will be graduating only two seniors and returning a handful of veterans.
