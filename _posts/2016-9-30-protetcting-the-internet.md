The internet is arguably the most prevalent fixture in our lives today. We use if for everything from checking the weather to understanding the many facets of controversial topics; therefore, the fight to keep it free and open is of great importance. The argument over net neutrality that has been happening in our government is very important, and we must do everything to protect our right to access the whole internet; but this is an issue that fundamentally cannot be solved with the current understanding of how the internet works and with the two sides that frame the current debate. Net neutrality plays an important role and is a necessary first step, but we can and we must do more to protect the free and open internet.


The definition of “net neutrality” is an important question that must be answered before a discussion can be had on the topic. According to USA Today, it can be defined as the “open internet” or the idea that we should have access to any website or service at the same speed and on the same basis as any other website or service. This is contrary to the idea that Internet service providers (ISPs) can provide access to certain websites through “fast lanes” by deliberately delivering some website faster and other ones slower. At first, you might think that is a good thing, because really, who doesn’t want to YouTube cat videos faster or rant on Facebook in the fast lane? The problem with this idea is that it hurts other services and websites. By allowing ISPs to deliver certain content faster, we are giving them the power to censor our internet usage.[^1]



At the outset the, this idea of net neutrality looks like it will completely solve the issue of protecting the open internet, however, the problem is more complicated and needs a more comprehensive solution. People today look at the internet and think it works just how it worked when their parents first used it, but they don't realize how much things have changed in twenty years time. The idea of “fast lanes” is not a new ideal in fact, many of the largest internet companies already have similar deals with the major ISPs that are called “peering connections” or “content delivery networks” which allow websites and servers to cache their content in the data centers at individual ISP location so that users can access the data faster. If this is already industry standard practice, then we need to take a different approach to solving this problem. [^2]



Net neutrality in and of itself is not enough to protect the internet because ISPs have too much power over the internet marketplace. This goes back to the idea that monopolies are bad for competition in a free market system. The problem then, is why would we leave something like the internet, at the mercy of the biggest monopoly in our country, the federal government? Instead of going about this process in order to regulate the few ISPs, we should look for an approach that can open up the market for more players to jump in to drive prices down and service up for everyone. If we would have taken this approach twenty years ago when the internet was still growing, but now this has become a bigger and much more complicated issue with big players with lots of money who want to protect their interest. Over and over throughout history we have seen that the free market always pushes technological innovation to it furthest limits and bring about new ways of doing things that benefit all those involved. In order to expand both the access and speed for all resources on the internet, the free market must be left to run its course and create the most innovative way to promote access and protect the openness of the internet.

Even now, researchers are looking towards advancements in internet technology that could be a part of the future of the open internet. Several research students at Stanford University created and studied the use of a new technology called “Network Cookies.” These cookies allow users to set whether they want to access certain content over “fast lanes” or not based on their browsing habits and preferences. This not only protects the freedom of the internet, but also allows for greater speeds to popular services and is not beholden to the business deals made by ISPs and web service companies. Research needs to be continued, however, because the current implementation of these cookies is not very user friendly and will need to be properly implemented by ISPs in order to work. This also does not take into account how mobile and cellular data usage would be affected. 



Over all, positive steps are being taken to defend the internet and keep it free and open, but there is more to be done. Net neutrality is a crucial part of this fight, but there is more to be done legally, technologically, and economically to protect the open internet. Because the internet is such an important part of all our lives, we should take responsibility to see that the internet continues to be a open marketplace of information not beholden to the business dealing of the telecommunication giants.
