In Johnathan Swift’s book, Gulliver’s Travels he uses the main character, Lemuel Gulliver, to tell the stories of several different societies and how they either reflect current European society, or how they are better than society. Throughout his adventures, we learn a lot about Gulliver. As he progressively goes on more “travels” we see a shift in his attitude and actions. The environment that he lives in, both before, during and after his adventures, does in fact have a huge effect on his character as a whole and leads to a transformation of his whole person. 

Lemuel Gulliver is the third of five sons born to a lower-middle class British family. He grows up in Nottinghamshire, which is just an ordinary county with not a lot of excitement. He graduates from Emmanuel College, which although it is respected, it is not any more than an average school. From the outset, Gulliver is the epitome of the middle class. This almost stereotypical life lend itself to his “gullible” nature and how he doesn’t necessarily see the full situation at first glance. 

Gulliver’s first adventure takes him to Lilliputia, which is a place where everything is smaller by a scale of six. People are only six inches tall and even the biggest buildings are no more than a few hundred square feet. Gulliver is captured by them and although he is six times bigger than they are, he doesn’t realize that he could trample them until much later. His initial interactions with these people make him a little bit arrogant, which causes him strife later on.

When he wakes up to the Lilliputians, he sees he is tied up and they are crawling over him. However, Gulliver does not seem to do much of anything about it, despite his enormous size. In part because of his upbringing, he is gullible and does not realize that they are taking advantage of him. He furthermore is passive and does not take action against his captors. The passiveness from the outset sets the precedent for the rest of his adventures.
Later when Gulliver meets the giants of Brobdingnag, he is met with quite the opposite circumstances from his time in Lilliput. He is now the small helpless creature and needs the giants to help him. Again, he exhibits his naivety in the fact that he does not realize that the Giants are taking advantage of him. 

One interesting point about Gulliver is the fact that he know a lot. He is able to learn new languages quickly and has lots of practical knowledge. Sadly, this doesn’t do him much good in many situation, because he never actually saves himself from any of the people he meets. The passivity is most likely ignorance at first, but near the end of the book, he purposefully takes no action because he has given up. This giving up is a huge change in Gulliver’s whole character.

Throughout the novel, Gulliver changes his whole attitude towards people. At the beginning he is an open honest person that most people could see themselves having a casual conversation with. By the end of the book, he has completely lost it and he cannot even stand his own family. After his repeated exposure to the dishonesty of people in the world, he realizes that not everyone is as honest as he is and that people are pretty bad. This is one of two primary changes we see in Gulliver.

The other turn that we see in Gulliver is that he loses his pride in material things. At the beginning he recounts in detail his wife’s dowry, how much money he gave to the Lilliputians, and so forth, but by the end, he doesn’t even want to pay for the voyage with Don Pedro de Mendez. This degrading is not only restricted to money, but also material things. At the beginning he describes in detail the clothes he wore. He talked of how he was dressed when he met the Lilliputians, and how the child in Brobdingnag sews him clothes, but by the end, he is hanging ono to just some scraps of clothes until Don Pedro forcibly gives him another set of clothes. These two drastic changes in Gulliver happen because he is repeatedly exposed to the corruption of people who are not as honest as him.

The whole change in Gulliver is about a change from an open, “people person” to a closed, and depressed person. He loses faith in humanity and by the end sees all people like the Yahoos of Houyhnhnm. He learns to be content with little and learns that humans are basically bad. This leaves him finally as a depressed and doubtful person. 

Johnathan Swift uses these lessons that Gulliver learns in a powerful way to demonstrate the silliness of the European, and particularly the British, society as a whole. He wants you to have the same sense of hopelessness as Gulliver. Through his repeated similarities and uses of satire, he shows how silly the government and politics throughout Europe are. For example, when the Lilliputians explain their conflicts with the Blefuscu, it almost perfectly parallels the conflicts between England and France up to that time. 

As we follow Gulliver from place to place, his depression and hopelessness continues to grow. We see that as he realizes the truth about the world he loses hope in humans and how anyone could ever be truly noble. Swift wanted to show the people of his day how foolish the society really was, and how far the nations had come away from true virtue. He shows this drastic change in Gulliver’s thinking. The question now is, does modern day America need the same message.
