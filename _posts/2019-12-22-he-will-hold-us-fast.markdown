How do you know you are a Christian? Is there any way you can be sure of your salvation? Can you lose it yourself? These are all questions that most of us have wrestled with at some point, and maybe you are asking these questions right now. The book of Hebrews offers guidance and hope in our times of doubt and our response to what it says is very telling of where our hearts truly are.

Throughout the book of Hebrews we see several difficult warning passages. It is very important that we take the time to understand them correctly and in context in order to correctly inform our theology and faithfully pursue Christ. They are written to do just what they say, warn. Depending on our response to that warning, the rest of the passage will make it clear whether we are in Christ or not. One such passage we will look at is Hebrews 6, verses 4-6. You might have heard this passage quoted many times before in defense of a belief that Christians can lose their salvation. Our goal today is threefold, first, an understanding of what this passage actually says, second, a fresh assurance of our salvation, and finally and most importantly, a renewed zeal to persevere. Our outline today is simple, answer three key questions: Who, What, and Why. Three points and then we will look at what those answers mean for how we live our lives.
