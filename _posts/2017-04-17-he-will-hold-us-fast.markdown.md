title: 'He Will Hold us Fast'

How do you know you are a Christian? Is there any way you can be sure of your salvation?[1] Can you lose it yourself? These are all questions that most of us have wrestled with at some point, and maybe you are asking these questions right now. The book of Hebrews offers guidance and hope in our times of doubt and our response to what it says is very telling of where our hearts truly are.

Throughout the book of Hebrews we see several difficult warning passages.[2] It is very important that we take the time to understand them correctly and in context in order to correctly inform our theology and faithfully pursue Christ. They are written to do just what they say, warn. Depending on our response to that warning, the rest of the passage will make it clear whether we are in Christ or not. One such passage we will look at is Hebrews 6, verses 4-6. You might have heard this passage quoted many times before in defense of a belief that Christians can lose their salvation. Our goal today is threefold, first, an understanding of what this passage actually says, second, a fresh assurance of our salvation, and finally and most importantly, a renewed zeal to persevere. Our outline today is simple, answer three key questions: Who, What, and Why. Three points and then we will look at what those answers mean for how we live our lives.

## Context

Before we begin, let’s take a look at the context so we can understand where the author of Hebrews is coming from. Hebrews is a sermon[3] written down and sent as a letter to the scattered Jewish Christians in the various churches of the first century. It was written to encourage them in their faith, despite the persecution they faced, and to remind them of the immeasurable greatness of Christ and the necessity to persevere in Christ no matter what suffering and persecution they may face.[4] You can basically split the book into two parts. The first part being about who Christ is, and the second, beginning in the middle of chapter 4, being about what He has done. Our passage today comes near the beginning of this second part in the middle of a discussion about the High Priestly work of Christ. The writer begins into a lofty discussion of all that Christ does as our Great High Priest and what that means, and then, turns to his audience to remind them that there is much more, but they have not been growing and cannot understand anymore. He says in chapter 5 verse 12, “For by this time you ought to be teachers…” and again “…you have come to need milk and not solid food” just like infants! He continues this line of thinking that they should be beyond the basics of the Gospel and ready to learn and teach the deeper things of godliness. This is where we pick it up in chapter 6 verse 4.

## Verse 4

Verse 4 begins with the word “for” connecting back to the previous verse and the idea of God’s sovereign permission. Because of God’s sovereignty, the author says, “it is impossible”[5] again emphasizing God’s sovereign work, specifically in regards to the salvation of souls. Before he mentions what is impossible, he clarifies who it is impossible for. This is our first point, "who." Who is this passage about? He gives a list of descriptions in the following verses which will help to clarify who this passage is talking about and why the this passage is not talking about saved people losing their salvation. Our first point then is who.

## Verses 5 and 6

In order to answer that question he gives several descriptions of these people. These are the advantages that they had as members of the Christian community even though they were not truly part of it. 

First, they have been enlightened. This phrase comes from a Greek word[6] which means, "to give light by knowledge or teaching."[7] This type of language is not the normal language to describe a saved person. Throughout the New Testament, the writers use other, more familiar language such as "being born again" or being re-created, not some mere enlightenment.[8] Instead this describes an intellectual understanding of the Gospel, not saving faith. 

A second advantage these people have is that they have tasted the heavenly gift. The word tasted refers to a sampling or examining of something[9], not fully receiving it. The gift here is most likely referring to the ultimate gift of salvation through Jesus Christ, though some say he could be referring to the Holy Spirit. I would disagree[10] because the Holy Spirit is mentioned later in this verse as we will see.

The third advantage these people have is their sharing in the Holy Spirit. Notice the wording here, some would like to take this phrase as proof that it is talking about Christians, but it does not say they "were given" the Spirit, it says they "shared" or “partook” of the Spirit. This word references association, not possession. Whenever the New Testament refers to the Spirit’s relationship to the believer it uses phrases like “indwelling” or “filling,” always referring to the Spirit as within believers.

Fourth and finally, they have the advantage of having tasted of the goodness of God's Word[11] and of His power. This could be counted as two, but I will count it as one because they are so similar. Again, the same word “taste” is here that these people have only sampled, not receiving or fully experiencing it. They have seen from an outsider’s perspective the goodness of Scripture and the effect it has on people’s lives. They have seen the miraculous power of God in others, but have never experienced it for themselves.

[2] Throughout Hebrews, there are 5 warning passages: Hebrews 2:1–4 Hebrews 3:7–4:13 Hebrews 5:11–6:12 Hebrews 10:19–39 Hebrews 12:1–29. This will only focus on the main point of one of the more common warnings that is often used as an argument against “Perseverance of the Saints.”
[3] Although the author of Hebrews is unknown, it is very likely that it could be a sermon of Paul because of the similarities between Acts 13 where we have a written record of Paul’s sermon. Even if it is not Paul, that is not the point, the point is that whoever originally spoke it was either an apostle or a close associate of one and that someone in that same group edited and recorded it to send it throughout the Roman Empire.
[4] The theme verse of Hebrews is Hebrews 10:23 “Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful.” We should come away from the book with a renewed zeal in our perseverance, we need to continue to “hold fast” ‘till the end. We cannot do that in our own strength, but only because the one who made the promises is faithful to the end.

[10] Because the author uses the other things that could be referred to as “the heavenly gift” in the other descriptions, it is natural to assume then that since each of the other ones are referring to something unique in the list, this is also uniquely referring to the gift of salvation.
[11] As a side note, I would like to mention that the Greek word for “word” in this verse is not the typical “logos” as is in most passages. A different word is used that emphasizes the part rather than the whole. They have not experienced the power of the “whole counsel of God,” they have only heard and have an intellectual understanding of what they have been taught.
