The epic poem Beowulf presents an interesting conflict between the older pagan worldview and the newly arrived Christian worldview in Angle-Saxon Britain. It was probably written just as Christianity began to spread in the region, so although the poem is actually older, the scribes most likely altered the text slightly to appeal to the shift in culture. Despite its roots in Anglo-Saxon paganism, our current version of Beowulf presents itself as very much a “Christian” piece of literature.

Near the opening of the poem, when we are introduced to Grendel, it is said that, “He bore the curse of the seed of Cain”, (Foresman 11). These few lines might have been different in the previous version of the poem, describing a monster from Old Norse Literature. Legends that traveled over when Christianity came included those describing the seed of Cain as monsters. When he dies, he crawls off to join the devils in Hell (Foresman 11-12).

When Beowulf arrives at Hrothgar’s Hall, Hrothgar repeatedly thanks God for sending this hero, and how Beowulf will defeat Grendel. In Hrothgar’s first remarks he says, “God, in His mercy, has send him to save us”, (Foresman 16) and in his second speech, “But God may easily bring to an end, The ruinous deeds of the ravaging foe.” (Foresman 18) In the pagan Scandinavian culture of the time, Hrothgar would not be praising God for his hero, rather, he would be thanking “fate” or the like. These references were obviously added at a later date for the new movement of the culture. 

Later, when Beowulf defeats Grendel, sending him running into the woods, Hrothgar makes another speech to all those at the victory feast and says, “Thanks be to God for this glorious sight! … But the God of glory works wonder on wonder” and “Through all the ages! God grant you still, All goodly grace as He gave before.” (Foresman 22-23) Beowulf in his response also gives credit to God by sayig, “By favor of God, we won the fight” and “The demon shall wait for the day of doom, When to God of glory shall give decree.” (Foresman 23) It is stange that Beowulf, being a pagan hero, would give credit to God and would declare that he will only finally destroy Grendel when He decrees. 

Throughout Beowulf, phases and ideas that are not true to the time have seeped in to the story. Some are even contradictory to other ideas that seem more at home in the setting. The references to God and his glory and might were obviously no in the original, but were added to conform to the new push of the Culture towards Christianity.
