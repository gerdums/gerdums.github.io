The Master’s University and Seminary (TMUS) has a long history as an institution with a firm commitment and conviction for Christ and Scripture. Well known preacher and University president John MacArthur highlights this commitment when he says that TMU is “Rooted in an unwavering devotion to Jesus Christ and the inerrant Word of God, our world-class faculty and dedicated administration prepare each student's heart and mind for a life of eternal influence.”[^1]  This commitment goes long before Pastor MacArthur’s leadership and can be traced back to the beginning of the institution when it was started as The Lost Angeles Baptist Theological Seminary (LABTS) by Dr. William Matthews, the founder and first president. The institution was not started in a vacuum, rather, the institution rose out of a need to a place to prepare and teach men to preach the Word of God in a culture and church environment of growing modernism and liberalism. 

## Northern Baptist Convention Split

As the century moved on, the fundamentalists in the Norther Baptist Convention saw a growing movement of theological liberalism and modernism in their own denominational leadership. These people brought a questioning and outright denial of the inerrancy of Scripture among many other doubts in other key Christian doctrines through the centuries. In an attempt to appeal and stay current in the culture, they invariable gave up and compromised on the truth.[^2]

This all came to a head in the 1922 convention meeting when pastor William Bell Riley proposed a resolution that would require NBC pastors to sign the New Hampshire Confession of Faith. This statement upholds the inerrancy of scripture as well as other cardinal doctrines that were being questioned. At the convention, the modernist pastors proposed a counter resolution that “the New Testament is an all-sufficient ground for Baptist faith and practice, and they need no other doctrinal statement.”[^3] The modernist proposal won 1,264 to 637.[^4]

In response, pastor Riley, and several other fundamentalist ministers founded the Baptist Bible Union. After some rocky beginnings, they eventually changed their name to the General Association of Regular Baptists (GARB) in 1932. Los Angeles Baptist Theological Seminary joined with them shortly after, and it was this fundamentalist resistance against modernism that was the driving force behind the beginning of LABTS and the next phase of ministry for  Dr. Matthews. 

## Doctrinal Commitment

Clearly defined doctrine is crucially important in the life of the church. The notion that we just hold to the Bible or that we just believe the Bible and disregard what the church has taught through the centuries is foolish and leads to all kinds of theological error and ultimately, heresy. This commitment to clear doctrine was already evident before the beginning of the institution and is still today a hallmark of the school.

As Dr. Sweazy noted in his historical look at LABTS, “leading Baptist colleges and seminaries had been undergoing subtle but definite changes in philosophy, involving a de-emphasis of some important Bible and Baptist doctrines” and a shift towards liberalism. It was this environment that through the work of the Spirit and other faithful men convinced Dr. Matthews of the need to challenge himself and orthodox Baptists to establish a seminary committed to orthodox Baptist doctrines.

Throughout the institution’s history, we have remained committed to these core doctrines of the verbal, plenary inspiration of Scripture, the essential and unique deity and Lordship of Jesus Christ, and the absolute necessity of the new birth. One hallmark of the ministry of John MacArthur has been his commitment to doctrinal clarity and scriptural faithfulness. The doctrinal statement of The Master’s University (shared by Grace Community Church, The Master’s Seminary, and Grace to You) is one of the most comprehensive theological outlines of any school of its kind.  

Steeped in a Baptist culture that was leaning towards the left and was ready to abandon any resemblance to orthodoxy, Dr. William Matthews and others became thoroughly convinced of the need to begin a orthodox Baptist seminary to train men to preach the Word accurately and faithfully in the church of the next generation. It is this commitment to the person and work of Christ and the inspired Word of God that still remains a hallmark of the institution of The Master’s University and Seminary. This is not only clearly seen in the mottos for each institution (“for Christ and Scripture” and “we train men because lives depend on it”) but also in the biblical fidelity in the faculty and administration and commitment to Biblical education across all disciplines.

[^3]: This serves as a compelling example in history of the importance of a high view of Scripture and an emphasis on doctrine. The kind of tactics used by the modernists in 1922 has not gone away, theological liberals today still use similar logic to defend much of their heresy. E.g. many charismatic prosperity preachers will claim to stand on the Bible and the Bible alone while denying essential Biblical doctrines like the trinity.
