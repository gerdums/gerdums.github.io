Just last week, I turned on the new, and this is what I heard.

>With all this new home automation technology coming out and smart devices, cars, appliances and more, you think we have seen it all, but not so fast. One part time emergency responder and part time researcher has built the next evolution of smart automation. Introducing SkySmart – wait, what, Ahh—

What I just saw on national television was the making of a monster unlike any other. First, some back story. This part time researcher, Dr. Tim O. Thi was a rising figure in AI (Artificial Intelligence) research back in the early 200’s. He brought some huge breakthroughs such as building one of the first natural language recognition algorithms and building the first building automation system. His ideas were later bought by other companies, but he was still avid about bringing AI into every American home and workplace. Several years later, there were several investigation into his personal life full of corporate espionage, bank fraud, and even sharing government secrets with his mistress, who was a Chinese spy. He was stripped of all his job, his family left him, and he was basically homeless. He was able to go back to community college and got his EMT and began working for the local fire department. His shear genius truly shined through and he was very quickly promoted to Chief Paramedic. This position gave him more free time, as he wasn’t usually responding to emergencies any more. 

Throughout this time, he always dreamed of building a fully autonomous office building to be emulated across the nation as the epitome of efficiency, not only environmentally, but financially, and in regards to human resources. Over these years, he reworked some of his plans from years before to create this complicated machine. He still had many of his connections to the industry, so on his free time, he traveled to the private construction site to supervise work on the project. Being a government employee, no one second guessed the project as only state contractors worked on the project. 

Near the end of the project, Dr. Thi had to make a very tough decision. If he wanted to see this project through, the building would have to come to “life” in order to see its full completion because he had been called for a special cross country campaign trip for the mayor, as h was running for President. He decided it was worth it, so finally, the day before the trip, he placed some cells from a human brain stem into a specific compartment in the building, and turned on the power. These brain cells were able to run the entire computer network system of the building and construction site. 

Everything looked good and he was just about to leave when everything went wrong. The brain cells had grown exponentially because he left the flow of nutrients on too high of a concentration, allowing this new “brain” to take over the entire building! Before he could do anything, the brain locked the power controls and began to move cameras, monitors, and anything else so it could be fully aware of its surroundings. When it started to move, it crushed several on the construction crew, but when the police arrived, the monster took their vehicles and began to attack them with anything and everything on site.
